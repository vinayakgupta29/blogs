The country I call home is so beautiful that that America looks like a trash can in front of it. 
People here are so civilized that that Americans and Westerners are like uncivilized brutes with no civic sense at all...

Parents of this country are so educated and caring of their children that even a minor infliction on the child makes them 
worried sick and they give their children the utmost care. There's no such thing as *toxic parents* in this country.

The youth of the nation is Focused on the development of the country and humanity as Whole and not quarreling on the street 
on grounds of Language, Caste or Religion.

This nations' politicians don't divide them on meaningless basis just to make votes but rather all of them are Enlightened 
thinkers and beholders of *Dharma*. 

The wider population is educated and literate who doesn't fall for *political propaganda's*. 

The system of this country is so impeccable... So refined that even the Enlightened Era thinkers would revere this country 
as heavenly kingdom.

A nation so Holy so Divine with impeccable history and lore... The cultural leaders so grand and revered... The Holiest of Holy...

With a history of 5000+ years... And leaders so immaculate and incorruptible that the Great Demon Kali doesn't even comes close to 
them... They radiate such *glow* of Dharma that they are bright as a Thousand Suns in the Age of Darkness and Despair. The system 
of this country be such Dharmic that even Krishna would cry seeing such *Ram Rajya* in the Age of Kali...

O you commoner! ... My immaculate child of the Lord feast your eyes upon a country so safe that even Demons feel safe here...

Anyone that commits crime is punished and no-innocent is ever wrongly accused... The populous is such mature and Dharmic that 
there are not one case falsely accusing some-one the moral  values entails such empathy that one feels for others that even before 
saying people think a million times to not hurt the others' feelings...

The administrative system is so holy and immaculate it's *Ram Rajya* the civil servants refrain from bribes like oil repels water 
while the civil administrative system of the West is riddled with corrupt officials from top to bottom... A commoner faces a 
hell of a lot of problems in those western countries... From getting a single form approved to ease of doing Business for 
entrepreneurs... Those countries are controlled by some Capitalist Giants and they run all the major Businesses in the country.

But this is not the case for India... Here peoples Voices are heard... And their concerns are addressed... The government is 
democratic and *Of the People, For the People, By the People...* A government system with a functioning opposition that puts 
checks and balances to the government's actions... 

The government doesn't tolerate any kind of violence and disturbance to the civics of society... Even if they perpetrators are 
from their own voting Block... As stated *Dharma* applies to all not a few selected and Justice is *Blind* and doesn't 
discriminate people on any basis and no special protections are given to those that are from the voting block of the ruling party...

Such immaculate is my nation... Such Holy is it's system... 

The youth of this country is heard... The government listens to their concerns provides them with jobs and fair means of 
living and not just distributing pennies and hollow promises to them... They provide them with Fair exams and means to secure Jobs 
and careers... In the modern times there had not being a single instance of adulteration with exams or any kind of malpractice by 
the exam conductors and invigilators of the exam... 

The Education and Knowledge System values the learning ability and practicality of their discipline and not just rogue memorization 
of old fundamentals which systematically keeps the youth at a disadvantage unlike the west...  The young are Living the Indian Dream 
and as our Honorable Prime Minister said, "Acche Din Aane wale hai..."

At this pace I tell you "Hum Vishwa Guru Banke rahenge..."
