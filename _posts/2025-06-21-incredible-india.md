A nation so rich in it's history and heritage,<br>
A nation so proud of it's history and heritage,<br>
A nation ruled by kings of all kinds,<br>
From kind to cruel,<br>
From Greats to Incompetent,<br>
From Benevolent to Tyrants,<br>

In the lights of today, this is all but a memory,<br>
History to take pride in, <br>
Present to not be presented to none,<br>
The leaders of the masses are so putrid,<br>
It makes one's soul rancid, <br>

The bearer of the banners of preservation,<br>
Akin to nothing less of predation,<br>
Calling themselves the sons of Bharatmata, <br>
The mother calls upon the heavens' might, <br>
To shield her chastity from demons' blight,<br>

Dushasanas walk among us in the light of day,<br>
Clad as common men, yet far astray.<br>
The soul of civility lies cold in these lands,<br>
Where neither law nor mercy firmly stands.<br>

The jobless brutes, with chests puffed wide,<br>
Proclaim themselves as cultureâ€™s pride.<br>
With threats and chants, they roam the street,<br>
Where reason dies beneath their feet.<br>

Ages after ages Greats Saints came, <br>
Told the people to stay sane, <br>
Keep together thee will be strong,<br>
Dividen thee musn't to perils it belongs, <br>

Poised to tread such land Incredible, <br>
leave the sense of civic at home,<br>
Carrying such virtue is futile, <br>
least they be hostile, <br>

Hospitality is they proclaim, <br>
Torture is what I claim,<br>
Taking back the modern man,<br>
To ages ancient and bane,<br>

Claiming the knowledge <br>
from the Books their Holy, <br>
Change there be always<br>
Times be sad or be jolly,<br>

Pride in one's history<br>
one must partake, <br>
But the wish to revert<br>
is a folly mistake.<br>

The wheel of time paces forth,<br>
Never to south, Always north, <br>

Nostalgia is a poison, rotting the presents,<br>
Ravaging the future, for kings and peasants,<br>

For present one must care and<br>
Future one cherish, <br>
History be loved, but only in memories,<br>

Incredible India, the land of free thought,<br>
Brutes of culture to knees they brought, <br>
