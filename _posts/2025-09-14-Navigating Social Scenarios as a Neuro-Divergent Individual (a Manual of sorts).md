# Introduction

This Blog post goes over the idea and concept of handling social interactions in our daily lives as a Neuro-Divergent Individual...
It should be noted that this manual is based on my personal experience and may have some biases... There is no guarantee for it to be working at 100% accuracy as I'm too still learning from it...

## Finding a Practice Ground

One of the most difficult task is to find a practice ground for our social interactions... And I'm not taking home or school or work 
in this record because they become a negative feedback loop because as a Neuro-Divergent Individual we are more susceptible to 
criticism than others and it becomes of the <em>Embarrassing Memory</em>... 

So try it on Mode of Transportation... It doesn't matter whether you travel by bus, train or cab...Unless you are travelling by bike
or personal car or any mode of Transportation where you are the only one present... Then these people that are travelling along with 
you... even the driver is included as well... because they are strangers and have little to no knowledge of your past and if living 
in cities and metros it has very low probability of them find you again and even if they do... the probability of them remembering 
you out of the thousands of faces they see every day is very minimal... Near Zero...

Now you might be wondering how can I start a conversation with a complete stranger with no knowledge of who he/she is and what 
his/her worldview is....

- Step 1

Read the Room... If people around you have headphones on... or using their phone... or reading book, newspaper or magazines... 
You'd be better off to leave them... 

You can start a conversation on general topics like "Government (local/state/central)", "Politics", "Weather", "Economics"....

**Just make sure to read their response and don't ever stick to your point religiously**...

For example 

*the first instance is your line and the second/Response is the other guy...*

> You :The Local Municipal just sucks... Roads are filled with potholes and they are spending so much on metro....

> (Response) : No, I think metro is necessary too...

*here change your tone*

>You: Hmm, I guess we have to stand along with time and move forward...

Now take another example...

> You : Things are so expensive now a days... 
> Response : Yeah Bro, What can we do about it... It's the governments fault...

Another one,


> You: So this cab business seems kinda good, is it?...
> Response (usually) : No bhaiya... It used to be good before COVID after that it just cuts down on our pay... It's not as good as it used to be...


Although these are a few examples from my own experiences but you can try your own variety and flavour to it... 

AND MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS BE FLEXIBLE THIS IS NOT THE INTERNET... THIS IS NOT A SCHOOL DEBATE... DON'T STICK TO YOUR POINT RELIGIOUSLY

YOU ARE HERE TO LEARN AND NOT TO FIGHT IN A DEBATE... YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT GIVES POSITIVE REINFORECEMENTS ON SOCIAL 
INTERACTIONS AND NOT FIGHT YOU OPINION IN THE PUBLIC...


- Step - 2 

After enough social interactions outside on your practice ground give it a try at the usual places i.e work or school or home or 
family gatherings...

Take note of your actions and people's reactions... Although there isn't a mathematical matrix to it yet but you can make a series 
of parameters that you judge your own interactions... and instead of dreadful judging like "Oh Shit! I'm such an asshole... I've made 
a fool of myself...", prefer to perform scientific evaluation... And see where you got better and where you got worse...

and based on this evaulation iterate and practice in your practice grounds... and then move back in...


- Step - 3

Reap the benefits of your iterative method...
